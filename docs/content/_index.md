My personal goal is to have a personal cloud environment at home. Building it from scratch would help me to understand Kubernetes cluster solutions for future reference. Another advantage of building it from the bottom up is that, if something breaks, you will at least have some idea about what might be wrong.

This is an educational project to build personal homelab to explore technologies
