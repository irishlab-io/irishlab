# CICD Pipelines

Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) are software development practices that help teams deliver code changes more often and reliably:

* Continuous integration: A practice where developers frequently merge code changes into a shared source code repository. Automated builds and tests are run to validate the changes and detect integration errors.
* Continuous delivery: An extension of continuous integration that automatically deploys code changes to a testing or production environment after the build stage. The final push to production can be decided by a person, an automated test, or a business rule.
* Continuous deployment: Automatically releases updates into the production environment.
