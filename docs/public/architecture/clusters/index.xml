      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always been amazed by cloud and virtualization technologies, so I decided to dive into Kubernetes and containerization. However, a few months ago, I found myself frustrated by how abstract and theoretical Kubernetes felt in online courses. I realized the best way to truly understand it was to build something real.

      <description>These hypervisors run on a conventional operating system (OS) just as other computer programs do. A virtual machine monitor runs as a process on the host, such as VirtualBox. Type-2 hypervisors abstract guest operating systems from the host operating system, effectively creating an isolated system that can be interacted with by the host. Examples of Type-2 hypervisor include VirtualBox and VMware Workstation.&#xA;Cluster of cluster Creating a private cloud mean that I will need to provision various workload in various environment.</description>
