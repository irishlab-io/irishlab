      <description>Continuous Delivery Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage.&#xA;This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button.&#xA;In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements.</description>

      <description>Continuous Deployment Continuous deployment goes one step further than continuous delivery. With this practice, every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is released to your customers. There&amp;rsquo;s no human intervention, and only a failed test will prevent a new change to be deployed to production.&#xA;Continuous deployment is an excellent way to accelerate the feedback loop with your customers and take pressure off the team as there isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;release day&amp;rdquo; anymore.</description>
